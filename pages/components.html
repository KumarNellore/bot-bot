<h2>Components</h2>
<p align="justify">
	<b>bot-bot</b> have following three different components in it:</br>
<ul>
	<li><b><a href="#server">Server</a></b> - the server is used to record user actions
		through <i>Recorder</i>. It also allows the users to export their
		test-cases so that they can be run with the <i>Runner</i>.</li>
	<li><b><a href="#recorder">Recorder</a></b> - Recorder is used to record user actions at
		the android app side and then send them to the <i>Server</i>.</li>
	<li><b><a href="#runner">Runner</a></b> - This is the main part of bot-bot. The runner
		allows the user to run their recorded test-cases on the actual android
		application as a suite. It also generated emailable html reports for
		your test execution.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
	<u><a name="server">Server</a></u>
</h2>
<h3><p align="justify">Introduction:</p></h3>
<p><strong>Bot-bot server</strong> is used to record, store and modify the user actions taken on the android app at the user end/system.</br>
It is deployed on a web-servlet supported webserver and currently uses a <i>h2</i> database to persist the data.</p>
<p>It have the following functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>View recorded sessions</li>
<li>View recorded entries for a particular session.</li>
<li>Persist recorded sesions.</li>
<li>Allow users to edit recorded sessions</li>
<li>Allow users to export the recorded steps into a <i>"csv"</i> file. This file can then be used with <i><b>bot-bot runner</b></i> for you test-suite exeution.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
	<u><a name="recorder">Recorder</a></u>
</h2>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>

<p align="justify"><strong>Recorder</strong> is used to record user actions on the android app under test and send these actions to the <strong>bot-bot server</strong>.
The recording can be done through simulator or using an actual phone.</br></br>
Recorder will record the basic commands for your user-actions. These steps can then be modified to make an actual test-scenarios by inserting extra commands like <i>asserts,verify,waitfor etc.</i></br>
Recorder creates a new session with the server whenever the app is launched. Once a session is created further recording commands are sent to the said session.</br>
Recorder records most of the user action done on the android app. Some of the actions like a back key on the keyboard cannot be recoreded, as it may be over a softkeyboard or a text box.</br>
If you need to add such scenarios, you can modify the recorded scripts to simulate required key-press.</p>


<hr/>
<h2>
	<u><a name="runner">Runner</a></u>
</h2>
<h3>Introduction :</h3>
<p><strong>Runner</strong> is the component that actually runs your recorded scripts onto your application as a Test-suite.</p>
<p><i><b>bot-bot</b></i> is based on keyword driven approach and uses "csv" to define its test-cases. The server & recorder records the test-cases as required by the <i><b>runner</b></i>.</p>
<p>Runner internally uses following open-source tools for test execution and reporting:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/nativedriver/">Selenium Nativedriver</a></li>
<li><a href="http://testng.org/doc/index.html">TestNG</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sikuli.org/">Sikuli</a></li>
</ol>
</br>
To run your testcases as a test-suite, just place your test-cases(which are in "csv" format) in folders(Used as module) or sub-folders(sub-modules) under a single folder for your app under <i>resources</i> folder of the <i><b>runner</b></i>.</br>
Also mention your suite folder name and app details inside the default.properties file present in the root of the runner.</br>
When you run the <i>runner</i> , it will automatically identify the files under folders and sub-folders and accordingly execute them. At the end of the test execution runner will generate html report with your fodlers/modules & sub-folders/submodules defined in the same hierarchy as defined by you.</br>
More information on the reports can be found <a href="reports.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This tool requires source code of the app that is being automated to be available.
